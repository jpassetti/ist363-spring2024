## Creative coding: Remixes

I've selected eight submissions from our creative coding assignment for a unique challenge – the Remix Project. Your task is to dive deep into one project of your choosing.

Here’s what you need to do:

- Download all eight projects.
- Open them in your browser to see them in action.
- Examine the code in VS Code to understand how they work.
- Choose one project to remix. Please choose one other than your own. Remix means taking the existing code and making it your own through additions, deletions, or any modifications you see fit.

At the very minimum, consider making simple changes like adjusting colors, sizes, or introducing elements of randomness. If you're feeling ambitious, why not explore more complex concepts like collision detection or simulating forces such as gravity? Don’t worry if you’re not sure how to implement your ideas right away; this is the perfect opportunity to ask questions, seek out information, and grow as a coder.

You are encouraged to consult p5.js documentation, search online for solutions, discuss with me, or even use ChatGPT for guidance. However, if you do use ChatGPT, aim to keep the solutions straightforward. More importantly, I want you to fully understand and be able to explain any changes you make. Simply copying and pasting code without comprehension won't do; let's ensure that your remix is not just a product of code, but also of your understanding and creativity.

This exercise is designed to push your boundaries, spark your curiosity, and enhance your problem-solving skills. Embrace the challenge, and let's see how you can put your unique stamp on these projects.

Looking forward to seeing your creative remixes!

## Video 3: HTML, CSS and components

This video will walk you through the process of constructing color blocks using components while utilizing HTML and CSS. The goal is to set up the preliminary structure of the website and to understand how to use components to create a more organized and efficient code.

### Video Content

- Create basic regions (header, main, footer)
- Create showcase component
- Create state to toggle showcase component (expand/collapse)
- Create text blocks and smaller components
- Pass data into components

### Region: Header

The Header component will contain the Spotify Logo and title "Top 10 Artists". We'll lock in a specific height for the header and center the content.

The logo can be downloaded from Blackboard/Content/Final Project videos.

The Header component gets included in the Layout component.

### Region: Main

The Main component will contain the Showcase component.

We won't style the main region yet, as we'll focus on the Showcase component.

### Region: Footer

The Footer component will contain the text "This is an educational project using the Spotify API".

The Footer component gets included in the Layout component.

### Showcase Component

The Showcase component will contain the top 10 artists. We'll create a state to toggle the showcase component (expand/collapse).

We'll use other components to structure the Showcase, specifically Container, Row, Col, and other custom components.

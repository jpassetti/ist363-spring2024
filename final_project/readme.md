# IST 363 Advanced Web Design - Spring 2024

# Final project

## Overview

The final project is our opportunity to bring all of our skills together (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) and to push them further. Just when you're comfortable with a technology, I'm asking you to go a little further. The final project is a chance to show off what you've learned and to create something that you can be proud of.

We will be programming a web application that showcases Top 10 lists, powered by Wordpress and the Spotify API. The Wordpress CMS will allow users to create top 10 lists. The Next.js application will display the top 10 lists and allow users to view and expand the information.

## Requirements

The web application must be:

- Built with Next.js
- Use the Wordpress API to create top 10 lists
- Use the Spotify API to display information about the top 10 items
- Use SASS to style the application
- Use React components to build the application
- Use React hooks to manage state
- Hosted on Vercel

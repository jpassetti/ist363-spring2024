### 2: [Creative coding](02)

- Session 2 (Thu 01/18): Creative coding with p5.js

### 3: [More creative coding](03)

### 6 Videos: [Dev environment](06_videos)

- In this video series, we'll improve our development environment by utilizing Prettier, ESLint, Git and Github.

### 7: [Variables, objects, arrays](07)

- Session 7 (Tues 02/06): We'll learn how to use JavaScript to create variables, objects and arrays, but also how to use them in a real-world example.

### 8: [Fetch JSON](08)

- Session 8 (Thu 02/08): In addition to reviewing variables, objects and arrays, we'll learn how to fetch a JSON file and use it in our project. And we'll learn how to filter the data (time permitting).

### 9: [Filter array of objects](09)

- Session 9 (Tue 02/13): We'll learn how to use the .filter() method to filter an array of objects. We'll do a lot of refactoring and we'll learn how to use arrow function syntax, too.

### 10: [Filter and sort](10)

- Session 10 (Thu 02/15): We'll learn how to use the .filter() method to filter an array of objects based on category and the .sort() method to sort an array of objects by name or price.

### 11: [Review filter and learn SASS](11)

- Session 11 (Tue 02/20): We'll review how we used the .filter() method. We'll practice using the filter method with more examples and data. And time permitting, we'll also learn how to use SASS to create variables, nesting, partials and mixins. We'll most likely learn more SASS next class.

### 12: [SASS](12)

- Session 12 (Thu 02/22): We'll learn how to use SASS to create variables, nesting, partials and mixins.

### 12b: [Creative Coding Remixes](12_remixes)

- Homework: Pick another student's project to remix. Try to add new features, refactor the code, and make it your own.

### 13: [SASS](13)

- Session 13 (Tue 02/27): We'll learn how to use SASS to create variables, nesting, partials and mixins.

### 14: [SASS](13)

### 14b: [Homework video](14_video)

- Homework: I've recorded a tutorial video focusing on the use of SASS partials and mixins. This is designed to provide you with a deeper understanding of how to efficiently organize your SCSS code using the 7-in-1 pattern for partials, as well as how to leverage mixins, with a particular emphasis on creating responsive design elements.

### 15: [BEM](15)

- Session 15 (Tue 03/05): We'll learn how to use BEM (Block Element Modifier) to create a more maintainable and scalable CSS architecture. And time permitting, we'll learn how to use 
HTML, CSS/SCSS and BEM to create a responsive slider for our Airbnb project.

### 16: [Responsive slider](16)

- Session 16 (Thu 03/07): We'll learn how to use HTML, CSS/SCSS and BEM to create a responsive slider for our Airbnb project.

### 18: [React](18)

- Session 18 (Thu 03/21): We'll learn how to use React to create a button component and a homepage component. We'll also learn how to style components using SASS and how to create a header component.

### 19: [React: State](19)

- Session 19 (Tue 03/26): We'll learn how to use the `useState` hook in React to manage state in functional components. We'll create a counter component and a toggle component to demonstrate how state can be used to update the UI.
